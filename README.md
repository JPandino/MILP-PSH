# MILPM-PSH
MIXED INTEGER LINEAR PROGRAMMING MODEL FOR PUMPED STORAGE HYDROPOWER - MILPM-PSH

## Descriptiopn
Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) are energy storage systems that utilize upper and lower reservoirs, with reversible turbopump units, to store gravitational potential energy. This model for
short-term operation of a PSH aiming at maximizing profit trought price arbitrage in the energy spot market. 
This is an object-oriented, mixed integer linear programming model, that consider starts and stops of power units of the plant.  It is modeled in pyomo, high level optimization programming
language, that can be use together with the Gurobi, GLPK, SCIP and IPOPT solvers. The model is capable of obtained the better final response from profit optimization expressing the **monthly** operational planning for this.
